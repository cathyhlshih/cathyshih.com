The process involved sculpting the hair shape and placing hair card curves for with layers â€“ from the base layer to breakups to transitional layer.\nHair cards creation was done entirely within Blender, utilizing its hair tools, geometry nodes, and shader nodes. The final render was done with a custom anisotropic highlight hair shader created with Unity\u0026rsquo;s Shader Graph in the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).\nThe mesh consists of around 35k tris.
