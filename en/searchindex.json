The process involved sculpting the hair shape and placing hair card curves for with layers – from the base layer to breakups to transitional layer.\nExample of a choppy wavy haircut:\nHair cards creation was done entirely within Blender, utilizing its hair tools, geometry nodes, and shader nodes. The final render was done with a custom anisotropic highlight hair shader created with Unity\u0026rsquo;s Shader Graph in the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).\nThe mesh consists of around 35k tris. The images you see are direct screenshots from Unity without any extra editing or post-processing.\n"},{"section":"Work","slug":"/en/work/traditional-art/","title":"Traditional Artworks","description":"These are the traditional artworks made by me.","date":"December 20, 2020","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/traditional-art/CathyShih_TraditionalArtwork-thumbnail_hu50aafda09112da919ba980eff0636cda_4089613_420x0_resize_q80_h2_lanczos_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"232\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/traditional-art\\/CathyShih_TraditionalArtwork-thumbnail_hu50aafda09112da919ba980eff0636cda_4089613_420x0_resize_lanczos_3.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/traditional-art/CathyShih_TraditionalArtwork-thumbnail_hu50aafda09112da919ba980eff0636cda_4089613_100x100_fill_q80_h2_lanczos_smart1_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/traditional-art\\/CathyShih_TraditionalArtwork-thumbnail_hu50aafda09112da919ba980eff0636cda_4089613_100x100_fill_lanczos_smart1_3.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Traditional Art","tags":"traditional art, charcoal painting, watercolor, pastels, ink painting","content":"\rThese are the traditional artworks made by me.\n"}]
