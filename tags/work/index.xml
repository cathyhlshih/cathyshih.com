      <description>80s Mullet Hairstyle In Unity I crafted a 80s mullet hairstyle using Blender, adopting a common hair creation workflow often associated with ZBrush. The process involved sculpting the hair shape and placing hair card curves for with layers â€“ from the base layer to breakups to transitional layer.
Hair cards creation was done entirely within Blender, utilizing its hair tools, geometry nodes, and shader nodes. The final render was done with a custom anisotropic highlight hair shader created with Unity&amp;rsquo;s Shader Graph in the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).</description>
